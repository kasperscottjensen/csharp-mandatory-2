This is a bit of a comedic take on the assignment. I found it hard to keep concetrated if keeping strictly to making a football game,
so it kinda grew a bit.
The game contains a main menu with level selection and three individual levels.
The player is controlled with a character controller and a cinemachine free look cam that directs "forward".
The field resides inside a way too huge city model I found on Free3D, and is comprised og the player and a few different obstacles / npcs.
Both PC and NPC are animated - NPCs movements simply follow waypoints.
Other than that, I dont know what else is interesting. There are a few cool scripts and such, but nothing too flamboyant.

The objective is simple - kick the ball in the goal. Oh, and you can kill the zombies with it too!

Hope you enjoy!
Careful with your speakers, there is some badass music and effects in there too.

Wait, who said zombies?!
